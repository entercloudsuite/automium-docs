Automium provides Role Management out of the box.

While the infrascructure is created you can bind each resource with the right application role. For example you would assign a role to each instance to apply the right configuration to it.

One of the most important feature is the granularity for which every user of the system can be associated with an application role. For examples developers may only deploy to canary instances, project managers deploy to the production environment and sysadmins may scale up and down the infrastructure.

Every user can log into the Automium Dashboard or use the API to list the action he/she is allowed to execute.
