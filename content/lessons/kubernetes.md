Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform for managing containerized workloads.

Even if Kubernetes is not to be considered a PaaS (Platform as a Service) system, it's an application platform with widely adopted tools and practices.

Automium can be used to provision a Kubernetes Cluster as a service, battle-tested for Enter Cloud Suite.

Once the cluster is running, it can be managed and scaled as any other service of Automium.
