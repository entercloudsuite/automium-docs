Automium simplifies three of the most crucial scenarios of application management.

### Safe deploy of configurations

Configurations are defined as Ansible Playbooks and deployed as background tasks with different execution strategies.

### Lifecycle management of Docker stacks

Docker applications don't need specific Ansible Playbooks because are based on the well known Docker Compose format. Automium can provision Docker Swarm and then use it for running your Docker services.

### Provisioning of a Kubernetes cluster

Managing containers in a proper way need a mindset shift and new tools to orchestrate these distributed workloads. Kubernetes makes managing containers at scale seamless with low operational overhead. Automium can be used for provisioning a production grade Kubernetes cluster where you can run your containerized applications.
