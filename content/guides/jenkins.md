Automium provides a catalog of [ready-made  services](/concepts/service).
One of the available services in the [**Explore**](/concepts/explore) section, is Jenkins. 

Jenkins is a famous open source project that can be used to support **building, deploying and automating** any project. Jenkins provides **hundreds of plugins** to easily integrate your external version control system and, of course, Automium.

The steps to deploy the service are the followings:  
* Find the service (Jenkins) in the list and launch it.
* In the detail page, from the drop down list, choose the version of the service that fits your needs and fill out all the required settings.
* Press the **Submit** button to procede.
* An information page is displayed to have an overview of the next steps.

A Terraform file is created and the Infrastructure changes have to be applied in the **My Infrastructure** section. 

Once you have created the Jenkins server, you can [add a new Pipeline](jenkins-pipeline) to perform the scaling logic.
