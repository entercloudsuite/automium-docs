In our experience, operating large infrastructures, we have choosen to deploy a dedicated Load Balancer service for routing the users requests to applications and services. Automium provides [HAProxy](https://haproxy.com/) service for this purpose; you can add it, as we did before, from the Service Catalog. 

Once we deploy HAProxy, we need to configure the service for our needs.
