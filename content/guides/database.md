Automium provides a catalog of [ready-made  services](/concepts/service).

The first service we are going to add to our infrastructure is a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. 
  
The steps to deploy a service (those are not specific to the Database) are the followings:  
* [**Explore**](/concepts/explore) the available services  
* Find the service (PostgreSQL) in the list and launch it.
* In the detail page, from the drop down list, choose the version of the service that fits your needs and fill out all the required settings.
* Press the **Submit** button to procede.
* An information page is displayed to have an overview of the next steps.

A Terraform file is created and the Infrastructure changes have to be applied in the [My Infrastructure](infrastructure) section.
