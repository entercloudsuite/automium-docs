Automium provides a local LDAP service.

The main usage of the service is for authenticating Automium's users itself.

Automium Dashboards and API are integrated with LDAP also for authorization purpose, in order to provide roles management.

Other services that can be deployed with Automium, such as Jenkins, Portus, Vault and more, could be easily integrated with the Automium LDAP to centralize your infrastructure users.
